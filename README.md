Assignment to create a "Vector Image" in HTML5 Canvas. The goal was to create a canvas image with javascript. Similarily how one would use Illustrator to make a SVG rocket, our assignment was to create the same thing in self written code. While this could have been done in code and svg, the main reason for using canvas was its fast loading time with alot of content. This could have also enabled us to create a animation of our project to which I personally did not have time in the end of the assignment.
